##Pre-course exercise: Student Directory 

####Summary of Activity  
    
This was one of the Makers Academy pre-course exercises that introduced a number of mixed concepts that would be developed at length throughout the course.
   
This exercise introduced the very first concept of starting a project from scratch. The project activity built up as follows: 
   
+ Creating a Project Directory locally, a new GitHub repo, and linking the two together.   
+ Introduction to the use of the text editor (Sublime) for making the production code for the App. 
+ Introduction to the concept of Version control, creating a basic feature and then building on that funcitonality:
  - Version 0: Setting up the project as described above.
  - Version 1: Adding the first basic feature (namely creating a list of students).  
  - Version 2: Refactoring the code (this was the very first mention of 'refactoring').
  - Version 3: Introducing an array for the list of students.
  - Version 4: Introducing the use of Ruby methods to list students.
  - Version 5: Adding extra information using Key/Value pairs. 
  - Version 6: Adding user input into the App. 
  - Version 7: Building an interactive menu. 
  
+ Commiting each completed version to Github via the command line. 
    
####Lessons Learned     
   
This was the first exercise in the pre course material that had some semblance of an 'App' and was hugely helpful in showing how a project, however basic, might be set up and used. 
   
I enjoyed this exercise immensely, in the way I was using a number of different programs (GitHub, Sublime, Terminal) to produce something tangible. It added a little bit of confidence that the learning material was 'for' something (ie, it can be put to good use), and was a little less dry that the previous work I'd done to date.
